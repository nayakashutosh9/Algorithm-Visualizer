# Algorithm-Visualizer
This repo contains visual representations of popular algorithms which will help in knowing how an algorithm actually works.
## 1. Searching
This section contains the visual representaion of both linear and binary search techniques where the user will give a key to be searched and this will help in knowing how an element if searched.

## 2. Sorting
This section contains the visual representation of some popular sorting techniques like bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort and merge sort. This representation will help in knowing how these sorting techniques actually work.

## 3. Splitwise
This section contains the visual representation of splitwise app which help students in knowing the net debit or credit i.e, who need to pay whom and what amount. This helps in reducing complex structures into simpler ones by using graphs.

## 4. Travel Path
This section contains the visual representation of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm where the graph will be generated randomly and on clicking the solve button the shortest paths to all other vertices from the source will be displayed.
